# Library Server

- [Live Server](https://library-server.vercel.app/) ‚òÅÔ∏è

I have tried to build the backend of a **Library** in this project üôé I used **MVC** to structure my code

### Interesting Experience

I struggled the most when designing the database üôá

### Extra

- sensitive information is protected by environment variable

### Project Details / Api Documentation

- created all CRUD APIs for `Author` and `Book` model
- implemented user authentication for the authors
- APIs of `Book` are accessible to logged in uses only

- Base url `https://library-server.vercel.app/` + `/api/v1` = `{{VERCEL}}`
  - `api` is used to let the dev know its an api.
  - `v1` is used to let the dev know the version of the application.
- `req.body` is validated before through `User` `Book` `Author` model.
- Upon server starting [fake data](https://github.com/ThakurSaad/library-server/tree/main/utils) is generated about user, book and author.

### Book routes

All routes are authenticated
